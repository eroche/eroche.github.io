Interest in language and languages can easily become obsesive. It is for me. Here are some of the questions that I have been considering for a long time:

* What is syntax? Does it exist? Can it be described formally and operationally? How much of it can be done mechanically? That's my work on parsing/finite-state processing?
* Can we separate what LLMs know about language from what they know about the world?
* What's the limit in efficiency for Second Language Acquisition? What does it teach us about the nature of language?
* The origin of languages: 
* More generally, what is the nature of language?

## Parsing with Geometric Transductions

Symbolic parsing is possible! This is a large part of what I have been working on this past few years and I will be releasing a sequence of drafts (comments welcome).

## Transformer/Finite-State Transducer Hybridization

As mentioned above, symbolic parsing is indeed possible, it's actually also useful in the context of modern LLMs. Hybridization represents an attempt at combining two ways to analyze and understand language: symbolic processing and LLM's deep learning techniques. Contrary to recent claims, deep learning is not the only biologically plausible way to analyze language. Symbolic processing is equally natural, or biologically plausible, and there is a simple proof for that claim: natural language exists and it presents itself as a sequence of symbols. This double nature probably tells us something about the nature of language.

# Work on Secondary Languag Acquisition (Chinese)

My first few years of learning Chinese were both exilherating and incredibly frustrating. Exhileration from the sheer about of knowledge about the word. Frustrating because it seemed to be extremely inefficient; like putting gas in an engine and getting back a 1% efficiency. Was there a better way to reach a comp
